The conda environment can be created using the provided environment.yml file using the command:
conda env create --file=environment.yml

For the predictive analysis, use the notebook named PredictiveAnalysis_combined_markers.ipynb in the code folder. For the time-varying regression analysis, use the AssociativeAnalysis_routine_markers.ipynb notebook. The notebooks can be used with routine markers, tumor markers, or combined markers.
